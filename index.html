                Lions (Panthera leo) inhabit savannas, grasslands, thick bush, and forests. They have golden-yellow fur,
                with males sporting manes that vary from blonde to black. Females lack manes. Social by nature, lions
                live in prides and are skilled hunters with excellent eyesight. Their distinctive roar communicates with
                other lions and marks territory. In the wild, lions live 10 to 14 years, but in captivity, they can live
                up to 20 years.
